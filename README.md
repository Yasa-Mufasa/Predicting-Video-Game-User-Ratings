# Project Description

In 2018, the gaming industry generated around $135 billion, marking a 10.9 percent increase from 2017. Most of the growth in the gaming industry has been in mobile gaming, generating $63.2 billion. Console gaming generated $38.3 billion and pc gaming generated $33.4 billion. With so much money on the line, it is important to know which games will be successful.

Looking at the datasets about video games available on Kaggle, we can start asking questions and see if we can predict what the user's rating of the game will be.

For this project, I have the following 3 research questions:

1. Do ratings influence the number of games bought?
2. Do critic ratings influence user ratings?
3. How much time is spent before a game is rated? Is this time different between critic and user ratings?
4. Can machine learning predict what the user rating will be?
